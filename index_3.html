      epistolary non-linear narrative about adolescence, family, and immigration. His earlier poetry 
      collection and later foray into epistolary poetic novel marks Vuong as one to watch with the Los
       Angeles Times calling Vuong’s work,“of sustained beauty and lyricism, earnest and relentless,
      a series of high notes that trembles exquisitely almost without break.”</div>

       places himself furthest out on the sheerest,least sheltered narrative precipice—narrative at the far edge of narrative possibility…”</div>
